I study folk theories and their role in shaping peopleâ€™s behaviors, relationships, and experiences. I am particularly interested in the ways in which conceptual representations do and do not vary across development, across cultural settings, and across individuals. 

I am a Senior Researcher at the education research organization foundry10, where I am the Principal Investigator of the [Conceptual Development Lab](https://www.foundry10.org/conceptual-development-lab). From 2020-2025 I was the postdoctoral project director for the [Developing Belief Network](https://www.developingbelief.com/).
