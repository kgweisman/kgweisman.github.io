I study folk theories and their role in shaping peopleâ€™s behaviors, relationships, and experiences. I am particularly interested in the ways in which conceptual representations do and do not vary across development, across cultural settings, and across individuals. I am currently the postdoctoral project director for the [Developing Belief Network](https://www.developingbelief.com/). 

In Summer 2025, I will begin a new position as a preceptor of quantitative psychology in the Psychology Department at Harvard University.
