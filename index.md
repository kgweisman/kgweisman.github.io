I study intuitive theories, conceptual change, and folk philosophy of mind, with particular attention to the ways these conceptual representations do and do not vary across development, across cultural settings, and across individuals. I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Anthropology at Stanford University, as well as the postdoctoral project director for the [Developing Belief Network](https://www.developingbelief.com/).
