### About me

#### Current work

I am broadly interested in intuitive theories and conceptual change, with a focus on **folk philosophy of mind** — how ordinary people come to understand things like mental life, sentience, and personhood. I completed my Ph.D. in psychology working primarily with **[Ellen Markman](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ellen-markman)** ([lab website](https://markmanlab.stanford.edu)) and **[Carol Dweck](https://profiles.stanford.edu/carol-dweck)**.

Most of my work takes the form of behavioral studies with 3- to 10-year-old children and adults, but I also study how social-cultural forces shape people’s understanding of the world. I am currently working with **[Tanya Luhrmann](http://luhrmann.net/)** (Stanford Anthropology) as a postdoctoral researcher on the [Mind & Spirit Project](http://spiritualcuriosityandthemind.stanford.edu/), which explores how people in various cultural contexts come to think about "the mind" and how that shapes their spiritual experiences.

I also collaborate with **[Ellen Markman](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ellen-markman)** and **[Derek Powell](http://www.derekmpowell.com/)** on projects related to modeling and intervening on lay theories to effect behavior change by way of conceptual change, especially in the health domain.

#### Background

Before coming to Stanford, I worked as a research assistant for **[Elizabeth Spelke](https://software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/lds/research/spelke/elizabeth-spelke/)** at Harvard University (2011-13); as a research coordinator for the [Preschool Relationships Enhancement Project](https://curry.virginia.edu/faculty-research/centers-labs-projects/castl/preschool-relationships-enhancement-project-prep) and the [Effective Classroom Interactions](https://www.mooc-list.com/course/effective-classroom-interactions-supporting-young-children%E2%80%99s-development-coursera) MOOC at the University of Virginia (2011-13); and as the lab manager of **[Kristin Shutts](https://psych.wisc.edu/staff/shutts-kristin/)**' [Social Kids Lab](http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/socialkids/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2009-11). I graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.yale.edu/) in 2009, where I worked with **[Kristina Olson](http://depts.washington.edu/scdlab/)**, **[David Ross](http://medicine.yale.edu/psychiatry/people/david_a_ross.profile)**, **[Tamar Szabó Gendler](http://tamar-gendler.yale.edu/)**, **[Woo-Kyoung Ahn](http://ahnthinkinglab.yale.edu/)**, and **[Teresa Treat](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/people/teresa-treat)**.
